Hey there!

Our weights were too big (we learned too much) so we've uploaded them to Google Drive here

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LwgLiJn_LY77XTtQAi7JG1GukNvAzBaj/view?usp=sharing

Please make the directory "models/" and download the weights into "models/experiment_final.pt".

Then test_submission.py should run fine!

Thanks
